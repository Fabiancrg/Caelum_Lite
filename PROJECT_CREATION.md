# WeatherStation Project Creation Summary

## Overview
Successfully created a new **WeatherStation** project based on the **ZigbeeMultiSensor** project.

## Project Location
```
c:\Devel\Repositories\WeatherStation
```

## What Was Done

### 1. Project Structure Copied
All essential files and directories were copied from ZigbeeMultiSensor:
- ✅ Source code (`main/` directory with all .c and .h files)
- ✅ Build configuration (`CMakeLists.txt`, `sdkconfig`, `sdkconfig.defaults`)
- ✅ Development tools (`.vscode/`, `.devcontainer/`, `.clangd`)
- ✅ Project metadata (`.gitignore`, `partitions.csv`)

### 2. Excluded Items (Clean Copy)
The following were intentionally excluded:
- ❌ `.git/` - No git history (fresh start)
- ❌ `build/` - Build artifacts (will be regenerated)
- ❌ `managed_components/` - Will be downloaded on first build
- ❌ `dependencies.lock` - Will be regenerated
- ❌ Build logs and temporary files

### 3. Project Renamed
- **CMakeLists.txt**: Project name changed from `zigbeeTest` to `WeatherStation`
- **README.md**: Completely rewritten for weather station focus

## Project Features (Inherited from ZigbeeMultiSensor)

### Hardware Support
- **MCU**: ESP32-C6 or ESP32-H2
- **Zigbee**: Full Zigbee 3.0 stack with 5 endpoints

### Endpoints Configuration
1. **Endpoint 1**: LED Strip (WS2812B on GPIO 8)
2. **Endpoint 2**: GPIO LED (GPIO 0)
3. **Endpoint 3**: Button Sensor (GPIO 12)
4. **Endpoint 4**: BME280 Environmental Sensor (I2C on GPIO 6/7)
5. **Endpoint 5**: Rain Gauge (GPIO 18)

### Source Files Included
```
main/
├── bme280_app.c         # BME280 sensor driver
├── bme280_app.h         # BME280 interface
├── esp_zb_light.c       # Main Zigbee stack (49KB)
├── esp_zb_light.h       # Configuration headers
├── light_driver.c       # LED/GPIO control (19KB)
├── light_driver.h       # Driver interface
├── CMakeLists.txt       # Component config
└── idf_component.yml    # Dependencies
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Initialize Git (Optional)
```bash
cd c:\Devel\Repositories\WeatherStation
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Weather Station project based on ZigbeeMultiSensor"
```

### 2. Build the Project
```bash
cd c:\Devel\Repositories\WeatherStation

# Set target (if not already set)
idf.py set-target esp32c6

# Build
idf.py build
```

### 3. Flash to Device
```bash
# Erase flash (recommended for first flash)
idf.py erase-flash

# Flash and monitor
idf.py -p COM_PORT flash monitor
```

### 4. Customization Ideas
Consider modifying for weather station specific features:
- Add weather trend calculation (pressure changes)
- Implement data logging to flash
- Add wind speed/direction sensors
- Customize LED patterns for weather alerts
- Add battery monitoring for solar power

## Configuration Files

### Key Settings in `sdkconfig`
- Zigbee role: End Device (can be changed to Router)
- I2C configuration for BME280
- GPIO assignments for sensors and LEDs

### Component Dependencies (`main/idf_component.yml`)
- LED strip driver
- BME280 sensor library
- ESP-Zigbee libraries

## Differences from Original

| Aspect | ZigbeeMultiSensor | WeatherStation |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Project Name | `zigbeeTest` | `WeatherStation` |
| README | Multi-sensor focus | Weather station focus |
| Git History | Preserved | Fresh start (no .git) |
| Build Artifacts | May exist | Clean (excluded) |

## Testing Checklist

Before first use, verify:
- [ ] ESP-IDF environment is set up (v5.5.1+)
- [ ] ESP32-C6 or ESP32-H2 hardware available
- [ ] BME280 sensor connected to I2C (GPIO 6/7)
- [ ] USB cable and COM port identified
- [ ] Zigbee coordinator running (Zigbee2MQTT or ZHA)

## Support

This project inherits all features from ZigbeeMultiSensor and is optimized for weather monitoring applications.

For issues or contributions, refer to the main README.md in the project directory.
